# English-Language-Learning-App-For-Kids
Hacettepe CS Design Project
- A mobile application has been developed using Flutter Framework that can be run in both Android and iOS devices.
- An API has been developed and deployed to generate pronunciation scores for the kids's recordings.
- MFCC features were used in the feature extraction step and then ML models were trained in order to categorize kid's pronunciation data as PERFECT, CORRECT, AVERAGE and WRONG.
- Time series-specific Support vector machine and Random Forest Models have been selected for calculations as they gave the best F1 scores.
